# Understanding Student Dropout and Success Rates

In the realm of education, understanding the factors influencing student dropout and success rates is crucial for fostering academic achievement and retention. This project delves into comprehensive data analysis to uncover insights that shed light on these critical aspects. By examining various metrics such as demographic information, academic performance indicators, and socio-economic factors.

## Data Sources

- [Dataset on Student Dropout and Success](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success) - This dataset contains information used in the analysis of student dropout and success rates.

## Demographics & Background

**Key Insights:**

* The data suggests that marital status impacts student success and dropout rates, with single students showing both the highest risk and potential for success.
* The data shows that females are more likely to stay enrolled and graduate, while males have a lower presence in enrollment and graduation despite similar dropout rates.
* There is a strong correlation, particularly for lower educational qualifications like Basic Education 1st Cycle, indicating higher dropout rates.
* Strong positive correlation is observed in higher education categories and Basic Education cycles, reflecting successful outcomes.

## Academic Peformance & Enrollment

**Key Insights:**

* Younger students dominate the enrollment and graduation figures, while older students have lower participation and success rates.
* Students with lower admission grades (95-99) tend to have lower numbers of enrollment and graduation compared to those with higher grades.
* Higher admission grades (120-130) see significant jumps in both enrollment and graduation numbers.

## Financial & Special Needs

**Key Insights:**

* Non-debtor status is associated with lower dropout rates and significantly higher graduation rates.
* Up-to-date tuition fees correlate with significantly lower dropout rates and much higher graduation rates, indicating the importance of financial stability.
* Daytime attendance shows higher dropout and graduation rates, possibly due to a larger population of daytime students.
* Higher dropout rates tend to occur during periods of economic downturn (higher unemployment, lower GDP growth).

## Outcome & Performance

**Key Insights:**

* There is a clear correlation between the number of curricular units approved and the likelihood of graduation.
* Students who approve more units in their first semester have higher graduation rates and lower dropout rates.
* Courses with higher dropout rates include Basic Education, Communication Design, and Oral Hygiene.
